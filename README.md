SystemCalls-CSCE313MP1
======================
This project traces system calls for basic read/write operations through an Android Device (emulator), a linux system, and a windows system.


There are three source file directories:

-> Android: contains project for and android application in eclipse with an ADT bundle

-> Linux: contains basic C files and input files

-> Visual Studio: contains a visual studio project that runs the simpleFile.c application




The report folder has documents pertaining to my observations during this project:

-> System Calls contains text file and spreadsheet versions of the system call traces

-> The results of the timing and the system call mapping are also present in excel spreadsheets and png image files

-> The final report is also here in a word (.docx) document and a pdf
